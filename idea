i have alot of domains w/ nothing on them

i want an easy way to just scrape tweets which contain
the hashtag as part of the message

show images / vides

oEmbed protocol / Embedly (costs too much)

keep db of oembed responses?
have seperate cron job which searches twitter / pushes into db ?
keep db as flat file?

OK
might as well use revent

pieces:
 scanning twitter for hashtags, firing new tweet events (tweet data as payload)
 consuming new tweet events, looking up embed html for tweet,
  firing new embed events (embed data payload)
 consuming both events, pushes data into db

for now we'll ignore cache age, twitter sets their cache age
 to be forever anyway
